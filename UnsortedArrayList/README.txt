This project implements an array based, ADT, generic unsorted list.
When ran, the user chooses desired data type (int, char, student)
and the commands from the corresponding data type text document 
are ran against the list implementation. The output is written 
to output.txt. 

This project includes:
  -array based implementation of the List ADT
  -implementing generic data types
  -implementing and using dynamically allocated arrays
  -using generic data types at the application level, with both primitive data types
and user defined data types

To compile:
  $ make
  
To run:
  $ ./List
  
To clean:
  $ make clean
