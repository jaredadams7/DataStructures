This project uses C++ template mechanism to implement a generic SortedList ADT represented by singly
linear linked list. When ran, user can choose the desired data type (int, char, student) and commands
from the corresponding txt documents will be ran against the list implementation. Output will be written
to output.txt.

This project includes:
  -linked list implementations of the Sorted List ADT
  -implementing generic data types
  -using generic data types at the application level, with both primitive data types and
user defined data types

To compile:
  $ make
  
To run:
  $ ./List
  
To clean:
  $ make clean
